A simple implementation of the glsl math functionality. Without additional includes and any modules, only one header.

The basic mathematical functions were replaced by approximations, so that the accuracy was sufficient for visual correspondence of calculations. Therefore, attempts to use hash functions implemented with sin will not lead to the same results and may differ depending on the compiler flags.

Examples:
